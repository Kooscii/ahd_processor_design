    1.2 Testbench
        What you do in the testbench? 

        1.2.1 Functional simulation
            3 Screenshots for all cases, example 1, example 2
            each screenshot should be follow by a brief explanation
            Make the screenshots larger and clearer!

        1.2.2 Timing simulation
            3 Screenshots for all cases, example 1, example 2
            each screenshot should be follow by a brief explanation
            Make the screenshots larger and clearer!

    1.3 Analysis
        crtical path delay, latency, propagation delay
